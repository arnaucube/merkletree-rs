# merkletree-rs
Sparse MerkleTree implementation in Rust.

The MerkleTree is optimized in the design and concepts, to have a faster and lighter MerkleTree, maintaining compatibility with a non optimized MerkleTree. In this way, the MerkleRoot of the optimized MerkleTree will be the same that the MerkleRoot of the non optimized MerkleTree.
